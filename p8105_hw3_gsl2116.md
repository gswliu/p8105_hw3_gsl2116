Problem 1
---------

``` r
brfss_data = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health")

brfss_data$response = factor(c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))
```

**In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations? **

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  summarize(n_locations = n_distinct(locationdesc) == 7) %>% 
  filter(n_locations == TRUE)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 3
    ## # Groups:   year [1]
    ##    year locationabbr n_locations
    ##   <int> <chr>        <lgl>      
    ## 1  2002 CT           TRUE       
    ## 2  2002 FL           TRUE       
    ## 3  2002 NC           TRUE

In 2002, there were 3 states where 7 locations were observed.

**Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.**

Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.

For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.
